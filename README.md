## About Coral Protocol

The [Coral Protocol](https://www.coralprotocol.org/) is an initiative to create an open, standardized infrastructure for AI agent coordination. It builds on the MCP framework to enable multiple AI agents to work together collaboratively, addressing the limitation of isolated AI systems that lack mechanisms for interconnected workflows. The Coral Protocol focuses on:

- Agent Collaboration: Allowing AI agents to communicate, share tasks, and coordinate in a structured way.

- Messaging Layer: Providing a system for agents to exchange messages, similar to human messaging platforms, with features like threads and mentions.

- Scalability and Openness: Designing an extensible, open-source solution that can support a wide range of AI applications, from customer support to project management.

We released the Coral Server as an open-source MCP server to serve as the backbone for this vision. The server acts as a messaging hub where AI agents can register, communicate via threads, and coordinate tasks by mentioning each other. The protocol aims to foster a community-driven ecosystem, encouraging developers to experiment, contribute, and build collaborative AI systems.
